# TrustChain-Microfinance-Grid-Prototype
TrustChain Microfinance Grid is an upgraded blockchain-powered ecosystem with the aim of re-establishing trust and transparency in India's rural microfinance ecosystem. It connects the gaps between traditional lending institutions and underserved rural entrepreneurs by enabling a secure, auditable and privacy-preserving infrastructure. The TrustChain system incorporates multi-layer blockchain networks, organized as public, permissioned, and sidechain, to achieve transparent workflows for lending activities while protecting sensitive information for borrowers and lenders. TrustChain allows offline transactions, biometric and voice authentication, and zero-knowledge dispute protocols to ensure user participation in a world where users have little digital literacy or stabilizing connections. Additionally, TrustChain aggregates lending and regional financial risk data when examining lending transactions, providing macro insights to regulators, NGOs, and MFIs for enhanced action provisions to support financial inclusion in equitable and compliant designs.

Goal:
The objective is to develop a trust-based microfinance infrastructure that is inclusive, accountable, and transparent across rural financial systems. It will provide borrowers with equitable access to credit, while lenders and regulators will be given data-based assurances of authenticity and compliance - all subject to verification. The platform enshrines financial citizenship by employing decentralized smart contracts, zero-knowledge reputation systems, and multi-modal onboarding, thus aiding access for the most digitally disempowered communities. Ultimately, the goal of TrustChain is to create a scalable and legally interoperable system that enhances trust between all financial actors while advancing the vision of technology-centered, inclusive rural development.

Key Deliverables:
• TrustChain employs a multi-layered blockchain architecture that combines public visibility with discreet sidechain accounts so that every transaction can be traced while customer details remain private.
• The loan agreements utilize smart contracts to automate the approval of loans, the payment of loans and the settlement of disputes, removing intermediaries and added delays to transferring funds.
• A decentralized reputation engine continuously updates trust scores for borrowers and lenders, identifies fraudulent activity while maintaining a transparent trust record.
• The platform is workable offline and/or in low connectivity settings and allows users to transact safely via voice or security protocols like USSD and/or biometric authentication.
• Regulators and NGO entities have access to real time analytic dashboards to examine lending activity, identify outlier activity, and exploren and determine the efficacy of microfinance programs.
